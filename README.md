During this project my task was to identify the top 5 categories of social media content that are the most famous.


Steps:

1- Read the business requirement brief
2- Get to know the team for the project
3- Data cleaning and modeling


Instead of applying these steps in Excel i decided to use python to practice and improve my skills in pandas and matplotlib
I used jupyter notebooks and Google + Chatgpt 4.0 for help with coding.

the project is still ongoing and i will update tomorrow..
