During this project my task was to identify the top 5 categories of social media content that are the most famous.


Steps:

1- Read the business requirement brief\
2- Get to know the team for the project\
3- Acquire the right datasets\
4- Data cleaning\
5- data modeling\
6- data analysis\
7- Insights and business question answer.

Instead of applying these steps in Excel i decided to use python to practice and improve my skills\
I used jupyter notebooks and Google + Chatgpt 4.0 for help with coding.
