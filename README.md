During this project my task was to identify the top 5 categories perfered by the useres.
as well as provide valuabe insights and answer some more businees questions regarding the content data.



Steps:

1- Read the business requirement brief\
2- Get to know the team for the project\
3- Acquire the right datasets\
4- Data cleaning\
5- data modeling\
6- data analysis\
7- Insights and business question answer.



Instead of applying these steps in Excel i decided to use python to practice and improve my skills\
I used jupyter notebooks and Google + Chatgpt 4.0 for help with coding.


Using 7 different datasets, the firsts step was to understand the data model and figure out\
which datasets have a relation, then use only the relevant datasets that contain the data needed to answer the business question.\
then i explored the data using excel and worked on cleaning and transforming it in jupyter notebooks using Python and Pandas library.
